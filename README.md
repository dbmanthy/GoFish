# Speed
A quick and dirty project to learn godot and gdScript

Rules of speed (more or less):

1. can stack cards of the same value in your solitaire piles

2. can place cards of higher or lower value (numeric only not suit) on center piles

3. when clear out solitaire piles can "slap" either of the center piles. Those cards will be added to you cards for the next round

4. if you and the opponent are stuck click you deck to flip two new cards to center

5. to win slap the center pile with no cards after you have run out of cards in solitaire piles

6. I did't add any  ui, score keeping, or telegraphing. This project was purely for learning godot
